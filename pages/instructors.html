          jealously, pettiness, greed, selfishness. Give up meanness; no bully
          can attain mastery, Revile the beast. Don’t complain. The troubles you
          may have are mechanical; small and insignificant. They will pass. Be
          alone, but never lonely. You are all things when you stand alone. Ask
          for nothing. Wait. The one Thing will provide. Don’t be lead astray.
          Be cautious and suspicious in your dealings; for there is much evil in
          the world. No one is safe from it. Beware of false friends, criminals
          and cheats. Be trusting, find the goodness in all things. Forgive the
          most terrible wrongs but never forget. Turn your cheek again and
          again. Strike when it is called for. Strike quickly and without
          meaning. Don’t be cruel. When you find true fellowship welcome it and
          keep it sacred. Nothing is more real than lasting friendship. The
          cosmos revolves peacefully around the union that is true. We need each
          other. Watch carefully. Keep your ears open. Stay awake, Stop
          dreaming. Face reality; yet indulge yourself in fantasy and fairy
          tales. Have and keep, hope, faith and charity. Believe in your luck.

          Help things to grow, within yourself and the Ten Thousand Things. Walk
          softly, lightly.

          center. Flow. Remember you can do nothing wrong. Ask every question.
          Question every answer. Answer every question and answer with a
          question. Be One with the One Thing. Whatever may come do not give up.
